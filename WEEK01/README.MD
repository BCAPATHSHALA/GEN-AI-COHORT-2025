3. What is agentic workflow?
4. What is tools/functions in AI Agent?
5. How to build tools/functions in AI Agent?
6. How to build AI Agent?

## Assignments

1. `Assignment 1:` Build a ChaiCode AI Agent CLI

Create a CLI tool that can clone any given website locally and make it functional offline:

- User provides a website URL
