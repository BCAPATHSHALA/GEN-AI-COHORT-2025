## Assignments

1. `Assignment 1:` AI Agent for Browser Automation

### Instructions

- Build an AI agent that can interact with a browser like a human.

- The agent should be able to open a webpage, navigate through it, and perform required actions.

- For this assignment, instruct the agent with a prompt to:

        1. Go to ui.chaicode.com
        2. Locate the authentication form automatically
        3. Fill in the necessary details
        4. Click the action/submit button

### Submission Instructions

- Record a video demo showing the agent executing the full task.
- Share the video link along with your project code/repo.
- Code repo & Video link both should be accessible to view on Incognito mode

### Evaluation Parameters

    Correctness – Agent successfully navigates to the site and fills the form
    Automation Flow – Smooth navigation and human-like interactions
    Prompt Handling – Agent follows the given prompt accurately
    Code Quality – Clean, structured and easy to understand
    Demo Clarity – Clear video showing end-to-end working
